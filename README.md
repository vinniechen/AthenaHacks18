## Inspiration
In the spirit of AthenaHacks, we were motivated to work on an app relevant to issues that women disproportionally face. We were inspired to create this app after learning women generally tend to present themselves less confidently than men, which can affect others' impressions of them and their own self-image. With the help of our cheerful mascot Hera, we aim to help anyone and everyone appear more professional and poised in their lives.

## What it does
The app records your voice and analyzes it for "qualifiers" aka words and phrases that can make you sound less confident and authoritative. You can add custom qualifiers, and Hoots with Hera will present a summary of how many times you've said each quantifier after you've finished your speech. Hoots with Hera will also encourage you by letting you know if you used fewer quantifiers than your last speech. There is also a built in stopwatch for those who'd like to practice timed speeches.
